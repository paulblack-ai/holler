## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- FreeSWITCH over Asterisk/Kamailio (pending confirmation)
- Compliance as mandatory call-path gateway, not optional middleware (pending confirmation)
- Numbers as ephemeral pool (pending confirmation)
- Python core + C/Rust voice pipeline (pending confirmation)
- Local-first inference (pending confirmation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2 prep]: STIR/SHAKEN STI-PA certificate registration has bureaucratic lead time — begin registration during Phase 2, not after
- [Phase 2]: Research flag on compliance gateway — STIR/SHAKEN cert integration and 2025 FCC opt-out expansion warrant research before coding
- [Phase 1]: Research flag on voice pipeline — mod_audio_stream WebSocket integration and faster-whisper streaming config warrant research before coding
